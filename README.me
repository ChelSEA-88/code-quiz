This assignment was the most challenging for me. It felt very complex. As you can see
I did not finish! I feel very sad, but I'm submiting what I have so that I can get excellent feedback. 
I honestly got lost in all the variables, I understand the basics, and I do really feel like I could be getting somewhere, but there is a mental block
from brain to screen, to typing. I have requested a tutor. I hoping this will get me over the hump and really get a basic understanding of these concepts. I can tell
how easy and logical it is, it's like I have to train my brain to think that way and it is VERY VERY difficult. Looking forward to your feedback. 
Thank you
